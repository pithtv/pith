# Library Plugin

This plugin scans media directories for movies and TV episodes, fetches metadata for them
from TMDB. These are then searchable and playable from the Movies and Series directories.

## Usage

First, make sure your media root directory is set correctly (see [Files plugin](../files/README.md)).
Then, in Pith settings under the Media tab, under Library folders, click the "+" icon to add a directory. Select the type of contents for that directory from the dropdown.
